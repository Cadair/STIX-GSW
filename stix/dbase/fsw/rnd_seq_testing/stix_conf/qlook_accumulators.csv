Parsing rules -  channel bin lists may be parsed with - and the list must be enclosed with double quotes,,,,,,,,
"det_index_list and pixel_index_list lists may be parsed with commas and enclosed by double quotes; eg ""0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7"" for the pixel_index_list means the same as BIG8""",,,,,,,,
For channel_bin - ALL means all of the energy bins are separate channels,,,,,,,,
For det_index_list  - FOURIER means all of the detectors with grids ALL means the 32 detectors,,,,,,,,
"For pixel_index_list - ALL means all 12 pixels - BIG8 means the 8 large pixels- CORNERS means the 8 large pixels summed into 4 groups- ""0:1, 2:3, 4:5, and 6:7""",,,,,,,,
NB: * Field sum_pix fo flare_detection_2 is ignored,,,,,,,, 
The standard energy bin edges are from 0-32 corresponding to science event channels from 0-31.,,,,,,,,
e.g. the specification for the lightcurve channel bin," ""0-6-11-16-22-32""",,,,,,,
gives the science energy bins: ,"""0-5""","""6-10""","""11-15""","""16-21""","""22-31""",,,
these are the bin edges in keV:,4-10 keV,10-15 keV,15-25 keV,25-50 keV,50-150 keV,,,
The lightcurve bins are found in  stix\dbase\detector\EnergyBinning20150615.xls,,,,,,,,
