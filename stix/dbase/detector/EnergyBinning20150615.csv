ENERGY BINNING,,,,,,,15-6-2015
,,,,,,,
Revised Suggestion for Science Energy Binning,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Criteria,,,,,,,
,Quasi-Logarithmic spacing between Emin and Emax,,,,,,
,Monatonically increasing bin width,,,,,,
,Energy edges at integral values of keV,,,,,,
,"Fine resolution through microflare regime, 4-16 keV",,,,,,
,"Bracket Ba=133 lines at 31, 35 and 80 keV",,,,,,
,Boundary at Tungsten K-edge at 70 keV,,,,,,
